<h1><b>Assignment Description:</b></h1>

In this exercise, you will be building an application that displays a photo gallery of images and allows the users to navigate through the images, as well as view a larger version of each image.  Figure 1, below, is a preview of the photo gallery application you will create.  Figure 2, below, is a preview of an enlarged image from the gallery.

<h1><b>Background</b></h1>
One of the most powerful uses of JavaScript on the web is to modify page content based on external events, such as clicks or other user interactions.  Modifying page content requires a way to refer to different components of the web browser and the current document.  JavaScript specifies the objects, properties and methods of the browser and the relationship between them through a convention called the browser object model (BOM).

The BOM contains the <i>Document</i> object, which represents the contents of a document within the browser.  Because the <i>Document</i> object is where many of the changes happen in a dynamic web page, this object has its own object model, known as the document object model (DOM).  

In this assignment, you will explore the structure of the BOM and the DOM, and you will reference some of the basic properties and methods of objects in the browser and in a document to increase the amount of interactivity in the application.
